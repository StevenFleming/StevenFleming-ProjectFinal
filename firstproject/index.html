                  <p> Karate Island uses html and incorperates css for styling</p>
                  <p> The inspiration for this page came from one of my favorite spongbob episodes from my childhood, and is a "real life" spoof an episode where Spongebob goes to a mystical island to learn karate only to find its an eleborate pryimad scheme selling timeshares</p>
                  <li> <a href="https://github.com/StevenFleming/Vacation-Website.git"> <h3>Hawaii Vacation</h3> </a></li>
                  <p> Vacation Website uses html, incorpates some custom css and uses bootstrap features</p>
                  <p> This is my favorite webpage in my portfolo. After learning about bootstrap in the lesson my partner and I started playing around with different features and interactive elements. I think it came out really well. For the first time I felt like the skills I was learning came together to make a great product</p>
                  <li> <a href="https://github.com/StevenFleming/Fish.git"> <h3> Fish</h3> </a></li>
                  <p> Fish uses html, and basic elements of css</p>
                  <p> I created Fish when pretty much every element of coding was a massive struggle. However I still value this page because its a tangible reminder of how far I've come in such a short time.</p>

          <h1> About Myself </h1> 
          <p> I was born in Pasadena to my loving Parents Mark and Dara Fleming. My mother shared with me her love of cooking and the arts of cooking and being open and geneorous to others. 
          <p>My dad shared with me his love of althetics and humility it takes to provide for those your love. I played every sport under the sun growing up and fell in love with writing. For college I attended UC Santa Barbra where I studied Religious Studies and focused my research on State Formation in Iran and Tibetian Buddhism. I also focused my atheletics into  Upon graduation I felt very called to serve those in communites affected by disasters and to take direct action to help the human community navigate climate change. I became an Enviromental Scientist for Jesco on the Campfire Cleanup Project. As an Enviormental Unit Leader, I worked in the field testing for contaminatiates in the ruins of residents homes. I am extremely grateful to have been a part of that, and while the work was gruling, I slept well everynight. I also picked up Rock Climbing which has been a passion of mine ever since. While participating in the cleanup project I also saw the need and potential for and of technology in the field. Technology is essential to help humans respond to disasters and climate change. So I decided to learn Coding skills in the hopes that one day I could help develop the systems to help humanity better navigate its future. </p>

                      <p>I would see Shane Grammer's work every day in Paradise. His incredible art was a constant and potent reminder of the deep human element within my work as a scientist</ p>
                      <p> Testing for Hazards in the fields so "Hot Zones" could become Homes again was a deeply rewarding experience. In addition to honing by field skills as an Enviormental Scientist, I connected to members of the community and found depth of experience when listening to community members stories. Experiencing the whole gamibt of reactions to grief and loss deeply impacted me personally. Professionally it added a deeper dimension to my work that I had never really experienced before.</p> 
                      <p> I hope translate the professional and personal skills I gathered as a scientist while working in the Campfire project into my carrer as a Developer</p>
